      "message": "## What's Changed\n\n- **Add `shuffle` function** - for shuffling of Lua tables.\n\n### Reference Implementations\n\nThe `implementations/**` directory contains reference implementations of the SplitMix64 algorithm for other languages:\n\n- **C99**\n- **Python 3**\n- **TypeScript** \n\nThese implementations produce identical random number sequences for the same seeds, which makes them suitable for **networked multiplayer games** that rely on deterministic PRNG state. By seeding all clients with the same value, you can guarantee consistent simulation results across platforms and languages!",

      "message": "## What's Changed\n\n### New API\n\n- **`splitmix64.toss()`** - Returns 0 or 1 (coin flip).\n- **`splitmix64.dice(roll, type)`** - Rolls one or more dice of the given type. Returns a table of individual rolls and the total sum. Dice types: `splitmix64.D4`, `splitmix64.D6`, `splitmix64.D8`, `splitmix64.D10`, `splitmix64.D12`, `splitmix64.D20`, `splitmix64.D100`.\n- **`splitmix64.randomchoice(t)`** - Returns a random element from array `t`. Raises an error if the array is empty.\n- **`splitmix64.weightedchoice(t)`** - Returns a random key from table `t` where values are weights. Keys are sorted deterministically (numbers first, then strings) for reproducibility. Raises an error if weights are invalid.\n- **`splitmix64.state()`** - Returns the current internal state as a string for save/restore or full 64-bit precision.\n- ✨ **`splitmix64.new_instance([seed])`** - Creates a new RNG instance with isolated state. Optional `seed` (number or string) for reproducibility. Instance has the same methods as the global module: `random`, `randomseed`, `state`, `randomchoice`, `weightedchoice`, `toss`, `dice`.\n\n### Changes to Existing API\n\n- **`splitmix64.randomseed(x)`** - Now accepts `number` or `string` (decimal uint64) for full 64-bit precision. Lua doubles cannot represent all uint64 values.",
